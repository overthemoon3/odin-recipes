Hello! 

I've decided to revisit the basics and go through The Odin Project! So far, it's turning out to be a fantastic resource, and I'm looking forward to further cement my understanding of fullstack applications. 

This is an assignment from the 'Fundamentas' part of the course, and funnily enough, it coincides with me starting to live on my own for the first time, in an apartment in Santa Cruz! 

Truth be told, I have been struggling to cook consistently, and perhaps making a website that showcases all the different recipies I know could make for a good way of getting inspired! 

This project demonstrates confidence in writing basic HTML, webpage navitation, and using git effectively.
